# EOLES-Dispatch Model

## Description
EOLES-Dispatch is an cost minimization dispatch model aimed at simulating realistic wholesale electricity prices at an hourly time-step for the French power system. It takes as input a detailed description of the installed generation capacity and time series of determinants of the power dispatch such as hourly demand, renewables availability, hydro resources, nuclear maintenance planning or fossil fuel price variations.

## Steps to run the model
1. Specify a scenario by copying and modifying the <Scenario_BASELINE.xlsx> file
2. In the last section of <EOLES-Dispatch.py>, specify all the simulations needed with the 'run_model()' function and the following specifications:
  - 'scenario' - Name of the .xlsx in which specifications of the scenario to simulate are gathered (created in step 1)
  - 'year'     - Which year (among 2016-2019) should be considered for weather related and other time-varying inputs (hourly power demand, wind and solar production, ...)
  - 'outputs'  - Name of the (existing) directory in which outputs will be saved (/!\ create the specified directory before launching the simulation)
3. Run the model by running the whole <EOLES-Dispatch.py> script
4. Get output data from the 'outputs' directory
